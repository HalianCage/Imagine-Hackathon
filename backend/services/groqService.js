const prompt = `
You are an agricultural expert. A farmer has submitted a crop image and a disease named "${diseaseName}" has been detected.

Please respond ONLY with a JSON object in **${language}** (e.g., Hindi or Marathi) with the following fields:

{   
  "disease": "", 
  "description": "", 
  "symptoms": [],    
  "causes": [],
  "treatment": {
    "organic": [],
    "non_organic": []
  },
  "prevention": [],
  "note": ""
}

Use the variable **${weatherData}** in your response. It is an array, it contains current weather details in the following structure:

{
  avgTemp: (in ¬∞C),
  avgHumidity: (in %),
  avgSunlight: (in hours)
}

Use these values to guide the "note" **and** modify the "treatment" section accordingly. For example:
- If **avgHumidity > 80**, recommend faster-acting fungicides or more frequent organic sprays.
- If **avgSunlight < 3**, mention that fungal growth may increase and adjust treatment dosage or frequency.
- If **avgTemp > 35**, avoid treatments that may burn the crop or advise spraying in the early morning/evening.

If **${weatherData}** is null or missing, generate a general note and general treatment based on typical environmental conditions for that disease.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not include any explanation, introduction, or translation ‚Äî just return valid JSON.
Use very simple, farmer-friendly language in ${language}.
Make sure treatments are specific and directly actionable ‚Äî no vague instructions (e.g., "‡§®‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§§‡•á‡§≤ 5 ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§ø ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ü‡§∞ ‡§™‡§æ‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§ ‡§´‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ", not "‡§ú‡•à‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï ‡§â‡§™‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç").
Ensure translations in Hindi or Marathi are accurate, contextual, and meaningful for rural farmers.
